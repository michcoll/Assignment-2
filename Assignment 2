What is it about? 
-We want to help travelers connect with locals to improve their experiences abroad. Although 
our target initially will be public bases activities like shopping or museum going more could be 
added based on user preferences. 
- Who are the user groups? 
The user groups are travelers going abroad. This can be to and from any country. The primary 
demographic will be adult aged individuals. 
- Why is it important? 
Many people travel to experience something new or take a break from the day to day. Often 
times when people travel internationally they do not know many people or what are the best 
things to do while abroad. By connecting people via an online platform we can make the 
traveling experience more dynamic and enriching as a person will not only have a better 
experience while shopping or museum going but will also build international friendships. 
- What are the competitors? 
Directly the primary competitors will be services like Highlight, CitySocializer, Trip Advisor, 
Lonely Planet and Facebook. Each competitor has a different different value proposition to the 
traveler but they all can be a tool to connect people or provide insight on what to do while 
aboard. 
- Why is your idea better? 
This idea is better because it will connect travelers to outgoing people while during their travels 
who can enrich their experience abroad. The people connection is still important and this would 
be a great way to improve use technology to connect people
